# Admin CRM System Design and Planning Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design and planning for a comprehensive Admin CRM system for Lear Cyber Tech. The system will be fully automated and deployed at zero cost, with admin monitoring capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

- **Database**: MongoDB (using MongoDB Atlas free tier)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (free tier)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (frontend) and Render/Heroku free tier (backend)
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage (free tier)
- **AI Integration**: Hugging Face open-source models

## Module Specifications

## Automation Approach
All modules will implement automation through:
1. **Rule-based workflows** - Predefined business rules trigger actions
2. **AI-assisted processing** - Using open-source models for intelligent automation
3. **Scheduled batch processing** - For reports and non-real-time operations
4. **Event-driven architecture** - System responds to events without user intervention

## Integration Strategy
- **API-first approach** - All modules expose and consume RESTful APIs
- **Event bus** - For asynchronous communication between modules
- **Shared authentication** - Single sign-on across all modules
- **Unified data model** - Consistent data structures across modules

## Zero-Cost Implementation Strategy
- Utilize only free tiers of cloud services
- Implement serverless architecture where possible
- Use open-source libraries and frameworks
- Optimize for minimal resource consumption
- Implement progressive enhancement for feature availability

## Admin Monitoring & Reporting
- Real-time dashboards for system status
- Automated daily/weekly summary reports
- Alert system for critical events
- Performance metrics tracking
- User activity monitoring

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security scanning
- GDPR, HIPAA, ISO, NIST compliance measures
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations

## Deployment Strategy
1. Modular deployment approach
2. CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
3. Containerization for consistent environments
4. Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
5. Automated testing before deployment

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed technical specifications for each module
2. Set up development environment and repository structure
3. Implement core authentication and admin dashboard
4. Develop individual modules in parallel
5. Integrate modules and implement cross-module workflows
6. Perform security and compliance validation
7. Deploy to production environment
